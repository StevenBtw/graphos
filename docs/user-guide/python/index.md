# Python API

Grafeo provides first-class Python support through the `grafeo` package.

## Quick Start

```python
import grafeo

# Create a database
db = grafeo.GrafeoDB()

# Execute queries
with db.session() as session:
    session.execute("INSERT (:Person {name: 'Alice'})")

    result = session.execute("MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p.name")
    for row in result:
        print(row['p.name'])
```
