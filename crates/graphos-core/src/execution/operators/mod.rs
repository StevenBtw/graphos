//! Physical operators for query execution.
//!
//! This module provides the physical operators that form the execution tree:
//!
//! - Scan: Read nodes/edges from storage
//! - Expand: Traverse edges from nodes
//! - Filter: Apply predicates to filter rows
//! - Project: Select and transform columns
//! - Join: Hash join and nested loop join
//! - Aggregate: Group by and aggregation functions
//! - Sort: Order results by columns
//! - Limit: Limit the number of results
//!
//! The `push` submodule contains push-based operator implementations.
